## Is it free?

Yes, **memoria** is free software, licensed under the AGPL-3.0.

You can download the latest Android version from the [releases tab](https://github.com/xp4u1/memoria/releases) on GitHub at no cost. This is perfect for testing the app or if you're unable to make a purchase. However, please note that this version doesn't include automatic updates.

With that in mind, I would greatly appreciate it if you would **consider purchasing the app** on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.xp4u1.memoria) or the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/memoria-private-journal/id6621187886), if you're able. Your one-time payment helps cover development expenses, app marketplace fees, and supports the ongoing growth of the project. Your support is essential for maintaining and enhancing **memoria**.

## Synchronization Server

The app supports synchronization with any CouchDB-compatible databases, which can be either self-hosted or rented from a cloud provider.

In the [`./database`](./database) directory, you will find a sample configuration for a Docker installation.

Due to security policies enforced by modern Android and iOS platforms, the database address must meet the requirements for a [secure context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts). This means the database must be accessible via a secure web request (HTTPS). Consequently, addresses within a home network are not supported.
